### Hi there, I am Yige Li👋

I am a PhD student in the School of network and information security, [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). I am supervised by Prof. [Xixiang Lyu](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/xxlv/). 

### 🔭 My research mainly focus on:

- Understanding the eﬀectiveness of backdoor attacks
- Robust training against backdoor attacks
- Design and implement a general defense framework for backdoor attacks

<!-- ### 🤔 My Internship Experience:

- Beijing Samsung Electronics Research Institute (*2018.06-2018.09*)
  - Review study on model lightweight methods
  - Lightweight face detection based on MtCNN
- Beijing Thunder R&D Center (*2018.03-2018.06*)
  - Large-scale video retrieval based on perceptual hash
  - Web video annotation tool development -->

### ⚡ Significance of our works:

- **Neural Attention Distillation (NAD)**
  - A simple and universal method against 6 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks via knowledge distillation
  - Only a small amount of clean data is required (5%)
  - Only a few epochs of fine-tuning (2-10 epochs) are required

- **Anti-Backdoor Learning (ABL)**
  - Simple, effective, and universal, can defend against 10 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks
  - 1\% isolation data is required
  - A novel stratrgy benefit companies, research institutes, or government agencies to train backdoor-free machine learning models
